## This was built following a tutorial

I followed [a tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u71pHOyvBp0) to complete almost all of this project, having little to no experience with front-end development myself. This served as nice way to gain some experience and skills in web dev, despite not having any plans to pursue it professionally. It can always come in handy;;

The tutorial is called [For beginners: How to create a 'link in bio' page for Instagram (No frameworks)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u71pHOyvBp0), by [devaslife](https://www.youtube.com/c/devaslife) on Youtube.

## Functionalities

The functionalities are fairly limited, as this is a simple application. The main function of the website is to display buttons that link to other social media sites. There is also [Vanta.js](https://www.vantajs.com), which creates cool background effects in HTML elements - I've chosen the 'birds' effect and tuned the parameters to my preferences.


## Motivation

I wanted to gain some web dev skills + experience and I enjoy [devaslife](https://www.youtube.com/c/devaslife)'s content, so I followed this quick, comprehensive tutorial. I also saw the use case of using this for my own personal page to link to my professional socials like LinkedIn and GitHub. I don't have a personal page as of this project's publishing, so this is a nice starting point.

In addition to being a nice intoduction to frontend development, the "experience [of using just HTML, CS, JS, and no frameworks] helps a lot when debugging projects build with frameworks," according to devaslife [[timestamp](https://youtu.be/u71pHOyvBp0?t=151)].
